Spot Glyph

I loosely based my final spot on a galaxy - but very loosely. I wanted my design to have many delicate elements which contributed to the effect overall. So here is the run down of how my colored glyph works

My choice of hue was to refect both the softness of my spot design - and also the undertones of what a galaxy might look like.

hue: this is controlled by the opacity of the center flower. It becomes fully opaque the higher the hue is.
saturation: this is controlled by the circumference of the circles 
brightness: this is controlled by the number of sides on the background polygon. 

things I tried:

I changed the  number of sides to be effected by hue - as there would likely have been more difference with hue, however I found that this did not look as aesthetically pleasing as it did with brightness.

grey glyph 

My grey glyph is supposed to be harsher that my spot glyph. harsher lines and deeper colors.

hue: this is controlled by the expanding of the circumference of the two rows of center circles.
saturation: controlled by the opacity/color of the center circles
brightness: controlled by the number of sides of the polygon.

chosen differences between grey and spot

I wanted my grey one to be seen as more 'industrial' hence the harsher stroke lines and simpler strucure. in direct comparison I wanted my spot glyph to be a little more artistic - which is why I gave it more delicate design elements. I also wanted it to have a softer feel. The two have similar features but are a (kind of) ying/yang of each other. This was my goal.
